iv) For one of the 3 periods and one of the genre combinations given above, write an SQL query to identify the top 10 movies, based on movie rating. Consider only those movies that have received at least 50000 votes. Output the movie names, ratings, and optionally other details, such as lead actor/actress names. You are free to choose any period and genre combination.
IMPORTANT: Remember, when exploring a genre combination like Comedy, Romance you need to consider the movies which have at least these two genres present in their corresponding list of genres. For example, movies with “Comedy,Drama,Romance”, “Comedy,Family,Romance”, “Comedy,Romance, etc. satisfy the requirement.
Also, someone is a lead actor/actress if the ordering attribute in the title_principals table is 1.
v) Using the EXPLAIN statement of Oracle, generate the query plan used in the query in (iv) and discuss how the query is evaluated.
